Create a “Hello World” contract with a constructor, at least two functions, and a state variable, and Deploy to a testnet (Rinkeby).


### Prerequisite:
- Basic Solidity syntax.
- Testnets

### Objectives:
  - To expose students to smart contracts on Ethereum via Solidity. 
  - To expose students to basic deployment patterns.

The smart contract address is: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x70e9c5999fc7e3f4fd8d3df56bdb012716111e61#code
